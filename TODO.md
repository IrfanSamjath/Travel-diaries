# TODO: Fix MongoDB Buffering Timeout Issue

## Steps to Complete
- [x] Create TODO.md with plan
- [x] Update backend/db.js with enhanced MongoDB connection options
- [x] Add connection event listeners for better debugging
- [x] Update server.js with CORS, body parsing, and debug route
- [x] Test the backend to verify the fix

## Information Gathered
- The error "Operation `posts.insertOne()` buffering timed out after 10000ms" indicates MongoDB connection issues
- Current db.js has minimal connection setup without timeout or buffering options
- Post creation routes in backend/routes/posts.js use Mongoose save() method
- Environment variables are loaded in backend/env-setup.js with a fallback MongoDB URI

## Plan
- Enhance mongoose.connect() with recommended options:
  - serverSelectionTimeoutMS: 5000
  - bufferMaxEntries: 0
  - bufferCommands: false
  - maxPoolSize: 10
- Add event listeners for 'connected', 'error', 'disconnected' events
- Ensure connection is established before handling requests
- Add CORS and proper body parsing middleware
- Add debug route for testing POST body parsing

## Dependent Files
- backend/db.js (primary file to edit)
- backend/server.js (updated with middleware and routes)

## Followup Steps
- Restart the backend server after changes
- Test post creation functionality
- Monitor connection logs for any issues
- Use /test endpoint to debug body parsing issues
