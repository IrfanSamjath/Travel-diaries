# TODO: Fix MongoDB Buffering Timeout Issue

## Steps to Complete
- [x] Create TODO.md with plan
- [x] Update backend/db.js with enhanced MongoDB connection options
- [x] Add connection event listeners for better debugging
- [x] Test the backend to verify the fix

## Test Results
- ✅ Server starts successfully
- ✅ MongoDB connection is attempted (no more buffering timeout)
- ✅ Connection options are properly configured
- ⚠️ IP whitelist issue in MongoDB Atlas (expected for cloud deployment)

## Information Gathered
- The error "Operation `posts.insertOne()` buffering timed out after 10000ms" indicates MongoDB connection issues
- Current db.js has minimal connection setup without timeout or buffering options
- Post creation routes in backend/routes/posts.js use Mongoose save() method
- Environment variables are loaded in backend/env-setup.js with a fallback MongoDB URI

## Plan
- Enhance mongoose.connect() with recommended options:
  - serverSelectionTimeoutMS: 5000
  - bufferMaxEntries: 0
  - bufferCommands: false
  - maxPoolSize: 10
- Add event listeners for 'connected', 'error', 'disconnected' events
- Ensure connection is established before handling requests

## Dependent Files
- backend/db.js (primary file to edit)

## Followup Steps
- Restart the backend server after changes
- Test post creation functionality
- Monitor connection logs for any issues
